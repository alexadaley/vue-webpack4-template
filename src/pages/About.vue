          I lived in Omaha, Nebraska until I was about six years old, then I moved to Dublin, Ireland for a few years. This opportunity changed my life and made my world so much bigger, it is probably a lot of the reason that I ended up in Paris. After Dublin I moved back to Omaha for a year or so and then to Ohio until I was eighteen.

          I moved to the beautiful city when I was eighteen for university and have grown up a lot since then. During that time, I have traveled, worked bars, worked for prestigious organizations, made tons of mistakes, and had a lot of fun doing it. I am currently in my final year of university and attempting to figure out what in the world I am going to do.
