        <h2> PORTO, PORTUGAL </h2>
          Journeyed to the East of Portugal through the wine valleys where I discovered the love of my life—Pastéis de nata the famous custard pastry in Portugal.

        <h2> MARBELLA, SPAIN </h2>
          South of Spain for a few days with my gals. Stayed on the resort, went to the beach, and of course ate and ate while a man attempted to serenaded us with Sweet Caroline.

        <h2> PRAGUE-VIENNA-BUDAPEST </h2>
          Three cities in a week, my favorite city was Vienna because of the history and architecture but of course my favorite moment was at the Beer Bath—bathing in beer and drinking beer!

        <h2> AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS </h2>
          Finally found a place where I am not at all the tallest person in the room. Discovered many museums, Anne Frank’s house, and did you know the best McDonalds is in Amsterdam?
